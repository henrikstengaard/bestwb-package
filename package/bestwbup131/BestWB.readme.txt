Changes in this v1.3 update
---------------------------

New Features:

.AHI enables third party audio hardware under a unified interface.

Updates:

.IconLib46 46.4.513 -> 46.4.518
.ToolsMenu 1.9.1 -> 1.10.2
.TSGUI -> 2.6b21
.WBDock 2.13 -> 2.14

Bugfixes:

-Cleaned up the installation script.
-Improved some documentation.
-Removed DOSPrefs as its operation is both buggy and quite hackish.

Tweaks:

-MMULibs is now optional when going full install (Not in the Update).
-FullPalette can be easily toggled on or off quite easily.

Comments:

- To temporarily disable AHI, just move the AUDIO mountlist from 
Devs/DOSDrivers to Storage.
- To both activate and deactivate TiTleShadow and Fullpalette use the 
Prefs/WBStartupPrefs program.
